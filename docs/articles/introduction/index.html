            Typically, in classical IoT projects,
            developers have to face a challenging situation.
            They have to understand a heterogeneous technology landscape 
            consisting of diverse IoT systems and services from 
            different vendors and manufacturers. 
            This diversity includes variations in communication protocols, 
            data models for payload data exchange, 
            and security requirements. 
            IoT applications are usually developed 
            using high effort applied to a narrow and specific use case. 
            During their lifetime, such applications are difficult to extend,
            maintain or reuse.

            The Web of Things (WoT) provides a set of 
            standardized technology building blocks that 
            help to simplify IoT application development 
            by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm. 
            This approach increases flexibility and interoperability, 
            especially for cross-domain applications, 
            as well as enabling reuse of established standards and tools. 
            WoT unlocks commercial potential being held back by IoT 
            fragmentation

            WoT introduces a simple interaction abstraction based on
            properties, events, and actions.
            Any IoT network interface can be described in terms of this abstraction.
            By using this abstraction,
            applications have a common anchor to retrieve an IoT service’s metadata as 
            well as way to understand
            what and how the data and an IoT services' functions can be accessed.

            An IoT device's metadata, including all information needed to enable this
            common abstraction, is documented in what is called <strong>WoT Thing Description (TD)</strong>. 
            The TD is a central building block in the W3C Web of Things and can be considered as the entry 
            point of an IoT instance (much like the index.html of a Web site). 
            It provides information on which data and functions are provided, 
            which protocol is used, how data is encoded and structured,
            and security mechanism is used to control access, and further 
            machine-readable and human-readable metadata. 
            A TD is expressed in JSON-LD and can be provided by an IoT device itself 
            or hosted externally in a repository such as a TD Directory.

            In general, 
            WoT is a protocol agnostic approach and provides
            a common mechanism to define how specific protocols 
            such as MQTT, HTTP, CoAP or Modbus can be mapped to the 
            WoT’s interaction properties-action-event abstraction.
            </p>
            <p>
            This mapping and protocol specific metadata are provided 
            by the <strong>WoT Binding Templates</strong>. 
            A binding template for a specific protocol provides a guideline 
            how a client can activate each WoT interaction abstraction
            through a corresponding network-facing interface for that 
            protocol.

            The (optional) <strong>WoT Scripting API</strong> building block 
            defines an ECMAScript (JavaScript) API that closely follows the WoT Thing Description 
            specification and supports the WoT interaction abstraction. 
            It defines the interface between behavior implementations and a 
            scripting-based WoT runtime. 
            Please note however that implementations of WoT are not limited to 
            scripting environments. 
            Programming language APIs in Java or C/C++ can also be derived from 
            the WoT Scripting API.

            The Web of Things also provides guidance on <strong>WoT Security and Privacy</strong>. 
            WoT provides guidelines for the secure 
            implementation and configuration of Things. 
            Security and privacy 
            should be considered in any system implementing W3C WoT.
